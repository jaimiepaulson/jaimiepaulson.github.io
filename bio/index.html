          A native of New York, college-aged me decided to move west
          in search of fresher avocados. While living out west, I had
          the opportunity to perform classics, including Cat on a Hot
          Tin Roof and Tartuffe. I also performed for over 10 years
          with Some Assembly Required, one of the longest running
          short-form improv troupes in LA.

          In 2015 I decided to pursue my passion for travel full time.
          I bought a one-way ticket and backpacked around the world.
          (Indonesia has HUGE avocados!) I eventually settled in
          Japan, where I taught English to children ages 3-11. I met
          my husband on a rooftop in Tokyo, and at the end of our work
          contracts, we moved back to New York, got married, and
          adopted the cutest old baby cat. We named him Pablo, after
          our favorite Japanese cheese tart, of course! For proof of
          cuteness, visit @PabloLovesSushi on the gram.

          In 2020 I reunited with some improv peeps to create Tilted
          Frame @ Home, a new form of digital improv to bring laughs
          to viewers from the comfort of their homes. We were honored
          to receive the Selke Best Show Award at Pittsburgh Fringe,
          and were nominated for Best Streaming Show of The Year, and
          Best Improv of The Year, at the Young-Howze Theatre Awards.

        <h2 id="bonus-fun-facts">Bonus Fun Facts:</h2>
        <p>I have been performing improv since age 14.</p>
        <p>I have never eaten red meat.</p>
        <p>
          I have never eaten seafood on purpose. I once ate a small
          scallop that had been breaded and fried and looked like a
          tater tot. It was unpleasant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was once chased by a dog while wearing a giant bunny suit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm related to composer, Giacomo Puccini, and was promised
          other kids would find that cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was lied to as a child about what other kids would find
          cool.
